This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems effectively. We
obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course on parallel programming in just two
days of teaching time. Instead, this workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and
overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:
* What are the benefits of using the Caviness Community Cluster and how it compares to the other
  HPC systems.
* How to set up remote connections to Caviness.
* Use the UNIX command line to operate a computer, navigate the file system, and write simple shell
  scripts.
